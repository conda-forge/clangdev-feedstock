Subject: [PATCH 46/83] Improve ROOT startup time by not merging identifier
 tables

Each module has a set of identifier tables which aid lookup. Based on this
information clang decides if it needs a declaration to be deserialized.

Namespace partitions and other C++ entities may have semantically the same
identifier lookup tables across multiple modules. Since lookup is a heavily used
operation in compilers clang tries to optimize it as much as possible. In case
it sees more than 4 such lookup tables it merges them together into a single
table aiming to keep the lookup algorithmic complexity of O(1).

This logic approach has several assumptions:
  * The progam will use only a small superset of the modules it needs;
  * The program will be compiled in multiple TUs and merging of tables will not
    be called often;

In the interpreter context where we make all module available the merging of
such tables becomes CPU intense operation at runtime which produces a lot of
temporary reallocations. Moreover, we have seen a lot of profiles where the
merging operation dominates (by around 18%).

This patch tries to make the merging far less often. On some short benchmarks ran
locally we get (70-80%) runtime improvement and ~10% reduction in memory.
