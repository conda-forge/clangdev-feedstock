Subject: [PATCH 47/87] UPSTREAM: Add missing include to X86MCTargetDesc.h
 (#123320)

In gcc-15, explicit includes of `<cstdint>` are required when fixed-size
integers are used. In this file, this include only happened as a side
effect of including SmallVector.h

Although llvm compiles fine, the root-project would benefit from
explicitly including it here, so we can backport the patch.

(cherry picked from commit 7abf44069aec61eee147ca67a6333fc34583b524)
